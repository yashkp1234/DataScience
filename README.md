Data Science Learning Repository

This repository serves as documentation and a progress tracker for my learning and understanding of various machine learning algorithms.
All code is written from scratch, and datasets are from a variety of sources such as Kaggle, and sklearn's built in datasets.

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of various machine learning algorithmns, 
by creating them from scratch through the use of object oriented programming.

Classification and Regression algorithmns are placed in the appriate folders, tests are stored seperately. 
Feel free to clone and run the tests and modify the paramters for more optimized results.
